## How to run it on your local machine

To begin with,you have to save the stalker.py code in your pc and then make few changes in them .If you want to track prices of a different product other than mentioned here ,then simply change the amazon link with that of your product.(Note this would only work for products available in amazon as in this code  we are scraping the data of amazon page ,for any other site you have to make few changes in the scraping part and then it should work fine).

Secondly, replace sender@gmail.com with the mail id you want to send the mail with and receiver@gmail.com with the mail you want to receive the mail in . For the password of the sender part ,you first have to complete the 2 step verification process and then generate a Desktop password for the mail and paste it in the Password section [Ref](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7UkAcIFrlGo) . And Voila it's done!
